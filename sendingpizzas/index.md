# Non-Election Pizzas

We sometimes sends pizzas to help out folks who aren't participating in elections and have supported protests, rallies, strikes, and teach-outs with pizzas and donations.

We evaluate every request on a case-by-case basis using the following criteria:

 1. __Is your request specific__ We need an address, time, and a phone number of someone who will be there to receive the pizzas.
 
 2. __Are you the organizer of the event or can you connect us with them?__ We don't want to disrupt someones hard work by sending a bunch of unexpected pizzas.
  
 3. __Are folks coming together to have their voice heard?__ We tend to support folks engaged in civic expression (like a rally or protest), or standing up for their rights (like a strike), or doing something civicly minded (like registering voters or helping count ballots).
 
    We're less inclined to send pizzas to folks at work (like reporters staking out a courthouse). But if you've answered questions __#1__ and __#2__ it doesn't hurt to ask.

 4. __Non-partisan?__ We can't help folks promoting a candidate or political party. This isn't the same as folks organizing _against_ or _for_ a politician or their policy, as long as it's not about voting for/against them or for/against their opponent.

 5. __Non-violent?__ üçïonly pairs with peaceful assembly ‚òÆÔ∏è‚úåÔ∏èüïä.
