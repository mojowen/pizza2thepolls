# Partnerships
Pizza to the Polls loves to team up with like minded organizations and folks — whether it’s working together to support voters during elections, feeding groups of people coming together to have their voices heard, or providing grants for pro-voter work across the country.

We love to partner with organizations that fit the following criteria:

 * **Nonpartisan**: Is the organization not a political party, campaign, or engaged in explicit electioneering?

 * **Pro-voter**: Does the organization work to empower more people to vote or become civically engaged?

 * **Progressive**: Is the organization working for a more just, sustainable, and equitable future for everyone?

If the answer is yes, we’d love to partner.

### Feeding Your Movement
We’d love to send pizzas or pizza money to make your event a success. In the past we’ve supported striking teachers, airport protests, and marches. Read more about the information we’ll need [here](https://polls.pizza/sendingpizzas/).

### Election Day
We’d love your help making sure polling places in your community are stocked with pizzas — drop us a line if you’d like to adopt a few polling places in your local community and can keep an eye out for lines.

## Grants for Good

For organizations that meet our partnership criteria, we also offer direct funding of pro-democracy work. This work must include voter registration, advocacy for pro-voter legislation, or other pro-voter initiatives.

Some of our past grantees have been:

* [Mississippi Votes](https://www.facebook.com/msvotes/)
* [Korean Resource Center](https://krcla.org/)
* [New Georgia Project](https://newgeorgiaproject.org/)
* [Forward Montana](https://forwardmontana.org/)
* [Next Up Oregon](https://nextuporegon.org/)
* [Minnesota Youth Collective](https://www.mnyouthcollective.org/)
* [ActionTN](https://actiontn.org/)
* [Alliance for Youth Action](http://allianceforyouthaction.org)

To apply for a grant - reach out to [grants@polls.pizza](mailto:grants@polls.pizza) with a request detailing:

 * The size of grant
 * A short description of how the funds will be used
 * The time period for the work you’ll be doing
 * How we can send you the funds (webpage, address to mail cheque, wire transfer)
 * When you need an answer from us and when you need the funds to be delivered

Grants will be issued on a case-by-case basis and are generally between $5,000 and $15,000.

Grantees are encouraged to follow up with details of how the work went and some photos - this isn’t a requirement but we’d love to be able to show off your work to our donors.
