Americans are hungry for democracy and are turning out in record numbers to vote. But that means long lines and sometimes empty stomachs, which might discourage these brave patriots from performing their civic duty.

Fortunately Pizza to the Polls is here to deliver the one thing that pairs so perfectly with freedom: piping hot 'za. We take reports of long lines from folks around the country and then find local pizza places to deliver the goods.

## How it got started

The weekend before election day, news spread of long lines across the country at early voting locations. Thus, Pizza to the Polls was born. In a few short hours, we came up with a name, a Twitter handle, a website, and a plan: Give pizza to the people. And give people watching at home a way to help.

We took in reports of long lines and sent our lucky pizza delivery recruits out on their mission to save democracy. The feedback was immediate and immense: it fortified hungry voters in line, cheered up beleaguered poll workers, and put followers and friends to work finding other voters in need so we could send in more â€˜za.

What started out small - in a few polling places in Ohio, Florida, and Illinois - quickly ballooned into a nationwide effort. By the morning of Election Day we had raised $10,000 and were confronted with the seemingly impossible task of spending it all before the polls closed. As the day progressed we were bringing in donations faster than we could place orders - so we recruited and trained a team of over twenty volunteers from across the US, England, and Australia to order and coordinate the delivery of 2,368 pizzas to 128 polling places across 24 states.

By the time the dust had settled and the ballots were cast, we had raised $43,307 from 1,728 donors, and over 25,000 slices of pizza were consumed.

## FAQ

### Is this a charity?

No, so contributions are not tax-deductible. (But we are an official 501(c)(4) nonprofit, if you're a tax code nerd like that).

<hr>

### Who do you give pizzas to?

We send pizzas anywhere there's a line and ask our delivery people to give them to anyone there: people in line, their kids, poll volunteers and staff, and anyone else hungry for a slice.

<hr>

### So is this partisan?

No. Ain't nothing partisan about trying to make voting less of a drag.

<hr>

### Where do you get your pizza from?

We use <a href="http://slicelife.com/">Slice</a> to find pizza places close to the lines since they let us tip and don't require someone to sign on delivery. We like to go with the local spots as much as possible.

<hr>

### What if there are funds left over?

Every dollar collected will go towards feeding hungry Americans or supporting efforts to help more people vote. Any funds not spent will be saved for future hungry voters and/or marchers.

<hr>

### Hey can you also send pizzas to...

We've sent pizzas to rallies, protests, strikes, teach-ins, and folks exercising their right to free assembly. We know being a citizen of a democracy is more than just voting every couple of years and we're happy to help out with our leftover pizza funds.

If you're interested in receiving pizza or know someone who we could help please get in touch. However we're not going to send pizza  without touching base with the organizers first to make sure they're expecting food and that we're being helpful. If you've got something in mind please make sure you've got buy-in from folks on the ground and have their contact info so we can connect.
